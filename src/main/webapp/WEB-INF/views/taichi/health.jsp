    <p>
        (A) Musculoskeletal System
    <ol>
        <li>Strength: Low stances and constant shifting of body weight stengthen
            the lower limbs and improve overall muscle definition</li>

        <li>Balance: Helps to develop ones ability to maintain balance, especially for
            elderly people. "Computerized training lets people know what it feels like to be
            off balance. Tai Chi helps people develop strategies for what to do about it."
            (Research by Dr. Steven L. Wolf in the Department of Rehabilitation at Emory
            University School of Medicine showed 72 on Tai Chi program were able to hold off falls
            50% longer than 64 that were hooked to computers.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Posture: Improves skeletal alignment (spinal-skeletal alignment being a postural
            requirement in the practice of Tai Chi) and spinal degeneration
        </li>
        <li>
            Movement: Promotes overall bodily coordination, flexibility, and agility (multi-spatial
            coordinated movements being present in every Tai Chi form)
        </li>
        <li>
            Bone Structure: In slowing down bone loss, it helps to prevent osteoporosis, especially
            for women following menopause, and to increase bone density (Tai Chi being a weight-bearing
            exercise). (Actual experience has indicated that Tai Chi tends to increase the diameter of
            long bones -- those of the arms and legs --, especially for those students starting Tai Chi
            before the age of 10.
        </li>
        <li>
            Post-Surgery Considerations: Optimal exercise system for post-surgery and osteo- or rheumatoid-
            arthritis patients due to slow weight transfer, increase in blood circulation, and fluid movements
            in the joints
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> (B) Cardiovascular System
    <ol>
        <li>
            Increase in blood circulation due to relaxed routine as opposed to those exercises that constrict
            blood flow due to intense muscular contractions (University of Hong Kong)
        </li>
        <li>
            Having lower resting heart rate and blood pressure has direct impact on cholesterol level
            (hence, obesity) (University of Hong Kong)
        </li>
        <li>
            Decrease the risk of strokes
        </li>
        <li>
            In his 1996 study involving 126 post-heart attack patients, Dr. Paul Lam wrote: "They
            were randomly assigned to participate in either a Tai Chi class, an aerobic exercise
            class, or a non-exercise support group. The result: The patients from the Tai Chi group
            came out with better cardiovascular fitness and lower blood pressure than patients from the other
            two groups. To top it off, 80% of the people in the Tai Chi group kept up the practice of Tai Chi
            while the support group retained only 10% of its original membership"
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
        (C) Respiratory System
    <ol>
        <li>
            Increases elasticity of the lungs and respiratory magnitude of the chest cavity -- thus reducing
            ossification (hardening) of the rib cartilages, increasing the supply of oxygen to the tissues,
            increasing the overall breathing capacity of the lungs, and increasing the oxygen consumption
            efficiency (Beijing Medical College, University of Hong Kong, and Qufu Teachers University)
        </li>
        <li>
            Abdominal Brealthing:
            <ul>
                <li>(a) Tones the abdominal muscles</li>
                <li>(b) Increases lung capacity of oxygen intake</li>
                <li>(c) Massages the internal organs</li>
                <li>(d) Promotes efficient digestion and elimination processes</li>
                <li>(e) Helps patients with asthma</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>(D) Immune System
    <ol>
        <li>Increases levels of immunoglobulin (IgA) antibody (Henan Medical College)</li>
        <li>Heightens sensitivity of bodily changes (e.g., onset of illness, etc.) </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        (E) Nervous System
    <ol>
        <li>
            Better concentration span, better reaction time, and better balance (Beijing Physical Culture Institute)
        </li>
        <li>
            Helps patients with neuromuscular problems
        </li>
        <li>Brain Waves:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                (a) Increases the duration of alpha-wave and theta-wave states vs. beta-wave states, thus promoting
                memory and learning capacity
            </li>
            <li>
                (b) Improves quality of sleep
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
        (F) Psychological System
    <ol>
        Tai Chi acts as a natural tranquilizer -- helps one to relax while staying alert, thus reducing stress, anxiety,
        depression, and hypertension, which, if unchecked, could lead to many other mental illnesses in our current
        society
    </ol>
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
        (G) Other Misc. Effects
    <ol>
        <li>Increases awareness of surroundings</li>
        <li>Increases overall level of energy and stamina</li>
        <li>
            Tai Chi has also been known to assist patients suffering from the following: Atheroclerosis,
            Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, allergies, cancer, anemia, diabetes, and chronic pain
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        (H) Spiritual Development
    <ol>
        <li>
            Yin-Yang: Increases aiblity to achieve the Yin/Yang balance, thus promoting level of <u>physical</u> and
            <u>spiritual</u> health
        </li>
        <li>
            Chi Development: Opens the opportunity to cultivate Chi (internal energy flow via the meridians), thus achieving
            the ultimate goal of Tai Chi. (Side effect: opening of blocked channels)
        </li>
        <li>
            Initial Experienced Effect
            <ul>
                <li>
                    (a) During practice, student feels bodily warmth that is internally generated
                </li>
                <li>
                    (b) After practice, student feels "energetic" instead of "fatigued"
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
